Hi, i'm @JRKagumba, a passionate self-taught data scientist/ML Engineer and a freelance software engineer from Canada. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
